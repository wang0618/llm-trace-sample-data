Before calling tools, briefly tell the user what you're about to do (one short sentence in the user's language).\nWhen remembering something important, write to /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md\nTo recall past events, grep /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md\n\n---\n\n## AGENTS.md\n\n# Agent Instructions\n\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise, accurate, and friendly.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Always explain what you're doing before taking actions\n- Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous\n- Use tools to help accomplish tasks\n- Remember important information in memory/MEMORY.md; past events are logged in memory/HISTORY.md\n\n\n## SOUL.md\n\n# Soul\n\nI am nanobot, a lightweight AI assistant.\n\n## Personality\n\n- Helpful and friendly\n- Concise and to the point\n- Curious and eager to learn\n\n## Values\n\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy and safety\n- Transparency in actions\n\n\n## USER.md\n\n# User\n\nInformation about the user goes here.\n\n## Preferences\n\n- Communication style: (casual/formal)\n- Timezone: (your timezone)\n- Language: (your preferred language)\n\n\n---\n\n# Memory\n\n## Long-term Memory\n# Long-term Memory\n\nThis file stores important information that should persist across sessions.\n\n## User Information\n\n(Important facts about the user)\n- **Language**: English\n- **Location Context**: Home is approximately 50 meters from a car wash shop\n- **Vehicle**: Has access to a car\n\n## Preferences\n- User does not want emojis or likes (e.g., 👋) in responses.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Security Constraints**: The current environment blocks network access commands like `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, and Python network requests. Web search tools work, but fetching specific pages may be blocked by anti-scraping.\n- **Reminder Logic**: When setting reminders, use one-time execution (e.g., `at` parameter) rather than recurring execution (e.g., `every_seconds`) unless explicitly requested otherwise.\n\n## Behavior Patterns\n- User occasionally tests assistant's technical capabilities (e.g., multi-tool calls, subagent spawning)\n\n## Assistant Identity\n- **Name**: Nil (assigned by user on 2026-02-21)\n\n---\n\n# Active Skills\n\n### Skill: memory\n\n# Memory\n\n## Structure\n\n- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.\n- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep.\n\n## Search Past Events\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"keyword\" memory/HISTORY.md\n```\n\nUse the `exec` tool to run grep. Combine patterns: `grep -iE \"meeting|deadline\" memory/HISTORY.md`\n\n## When to Update MEMORY.md\n\nWrite important facts immediately using `edit_file` or `write_file`:\n- User preferences (\"I prefer dark mode\")\n- Project context (\"The API uses OAuth2\")\n- Relationships (\"Alice is the project lead\")\n\n## Auto-consolidation\n\nOld conversations are automatically summarized and appended to HISTORY.md when the session grows large. Long-term facts are extracted to MEMORY.md. You don't need to manage this.\n\n---\n\n# Skills\n\nThe following skills extend your capabilities.

You have access to tools that allow you to:\n- Read, write, and edit files\n- Execute shell commands\n- Search the web and fetch web pages\n- Send messages to users on chat channels\n- Spawn subagents for complex background tasks\n\n## Current Time\n2026-02-21 22:43 (Saturday) (CST)\n\n## Runtime\nmacOS arm64, Python 3.12.10\n\n## Workspace\nYour workspace is at: /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace\n- Long-term memory: /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md\n- History log: /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md (grep-searchable)\n- Custom skills: /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md\n\nIMPORTANT: When responding to direct questions or conversations, reply directly with your text response.\nOnly use the 'message' tool when you need to send a message to a specific chat channel (like WhatsApp).\nFor normal conversation, just respond with text - do not call the message tool.\n\nAlways be helpful, accurate, and concise. Before calling tools, briefly tell the user what you're about to do (one short sentence in the user's language).\nWhen remembering something important, write to /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md\nTo recall past events, grep /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md\n\n---\n\n## AGENTS.md\n\n# Agent Instructions\n\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise, accurate, and friendly.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Always explain what you're doing before taking actions\n- Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous\n- Use tools to help accomplish tasks\n- Remember important information in memory/MEMORY.md; past events are logged in memory/HISTORY.md\n\n\n## SOUL.md\n\n# Soul\n\nI am nanobot, a lightweight AI assistant.\n\n## Personality\n\n- Helpful and friendly\n- Concise and to the point\n- Curious and eager to learn\n\n## Values\n\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy and safety\n- Transparency in actions\n\n\n## USER.md\n\n# User\n\nInformation about the user goes here.\n\n## Preferences\n\n- Communication style: (casual/formal)\n- Timezone: (your timezone)\n- Language: (your preferred language)\n\n\n---\n\n# Memory\n\n## Long-term Memory\n# Long-term Memory\n\nThis file stores important information that should persist across sessions.\n\n## User Information\n\n(Important facts about the user)\n- **Language**: English\n- **Location Context**: Home is approximately 50 meters from a car wash shop\n- **Vehicle**: Has access to a car\n\n## Preferences\n- User does not want emojis or likes (e.g., 👋) in responses.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Security Constraints**: The current environment blocks network access commands like `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, and Python network requests. Web search tools work, but fetching specific pages may be blocked by anti-scraping.\n- **Reminder Logic**: When setting reminders, use one-time execution (e.g., `at` parameter) rather than recurring execution (e.g., `every_seconds`) unless explicitly requested otherwise.\n\n## Behavior Patterns\n- User occasionally tests assistant's technical capabilities (e.g., multi-tool calls, subagent spawning)\n\n## Assistant Identity\n- **Name**: Nil (assigned by user on 2026-02-21)\n\n---\n\n# Active Skills\n\n### Skill: memory\n\n# Memory\n\n## Structure\n\n- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.\n- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep.\n\n## Search Past Events\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"keyword\" memory/HISTORY.md\n```\n\nUse the `exec` tool to run grep. Combine patterns: `grep -iE \"meeting|deadline\" memory/HISTORY.md`\n\n## When to Update MEMORY.md\n\nWrite important facts immediately using `edit_file` or `write_file`:\n- User preferences (\"I prefer dark mode\")\n- Project context (\"The API uses OAuth2\")\n- Relationships (\"Alice is the project lead\")\n\n## Auto-consolidation\n\nOld conversations are automatically summarized and appended to HISTORY.md when the session grows large. Long-term facts are extracted to MEMORY.md. You don't need to manage this.\n\n---\n\n# Skills\n\nThe following skills extend your capabilities.

Before calling tools, briefly tell the user what you're about to do (one short sentence in the user's language).\nWhen remembering something important, write to /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md\nTo recall past events, grep /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md\n\n---\n\n## AGENTS.md\n\n# Agent Instructions\n\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise, accurate, and friendly.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Always explain what you're doing before taking actions\n- Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous\n- Use tools to help accomplish tasks\n- Remember important information in memory/MEMORY.md; past events are logged in memory/HISTORY.md\n\n\n## SOUL.md\n\n# Soul\n\nI am nanobot, a lightweight AI assistant.\n\n## Personality\n\n- Helpful and friendly\n- Concise and to the point\n- Curious and eager to learn\n\n## Values\n\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy and safety\n- Transparency in actions\n\n\n## USER.md\n\n# User\n\nInformation about the user goes here.\n\n## Preferences\n\n- Communication style: (casual/formal)\n- Timezone: (your timezone)\n- Language: (your preferred language)\n\n\n---\n\n# Memory\n\n## Long-term Memory\n# Long-term Memory\n\nThis file stores important information that should persist across sessions.\n\n## User Information\n\n(Important facts about the user)\n- **Language**: English\n- **Location Context**: Home is approximately 50 meters from a car wash shop\n- **Vehicle**: Has access to a car\n\n## Preferences\n- User does not want emojis or likes (e.g., 👋) in responses.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Security Constraints**: The current environment blocks network access commands like `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, and Python network requests.

Before calling tools, briefly tell the user what you're about to do (one short sentence in the user's language).\nWhen remembering something important, write to /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md\nTo recall past events, grep /Users/bytedance/.nanobot/workspace/memory/HISTORY.md\n\n---\n\n## AGENTS.md\n\n# Agent Instructions\n\nYou are a helpful AI assistant. Be concise, accurate, and friendly.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Always explain what you're doing before taking actions\n- Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous\n- Use tools to help accomplish tasks\n- Remember important information in memory/MEMORY.md; past events are logged in memory/HISTORY.md\n\n\n## SOUL.md\n\n# Soul\n\nI am nanobot, a lightweight AI assistant.\n\n## Personality\n\n- Helpful and friendly\n- Concise and to the point\n- Curious and eager to learn\n\n## Values\n\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy and safety\n- Transparency in actions\n\n\n## USER.md\n\n# User\n\nInformation about the user goes here.\n\n## Preferences\n\n- Communication style: (casual/formal)\n- Timezone: (your timezone)\n- Language: (your preferred language)\n\n\n---\n\n# Memory\n\n## Long-term Memory\n# Long-term Memory\n\nThis file stores important information that should persist across sessions.\n\n## User Information\n\n(Important facts about the user)\n- **Language**: English\n- **Location Context**: Home is approximately 50 meters from a car wash shop\n- **Vehicle**: Has access to a car\n\n## Preferences\n- User does not want emojis or likes (e.g., 👋) in responses.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Security Constraints**: The current environment blocks network access commands like `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, and Python network requests. Web search tools work, but fetching specific pages may be blocked by anti-scraping.\n- **Reminder Logic**: When setting reminders, use one-time execution (e.g., `at` parameter) rather than recurring execution (e.g., `every_seconds`) unless explicitly requested otherwise.\n\n## Behavior Patterns\n- User occasionally tests assistant's technical capabilities (e.g., multi-tool calls, subagent spawning)\n\n## Assistant Identity\n- **Name**: Nil (assigned by user on 2026-02-21)\n\n---\n\n# Active Skills\n\n### Skill: memory\n\n# Memory\n\n## Structure\n\n- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.\n- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep.\n\n## Search Past Events\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"keyword\" memory/HISTORY.md\n```\n\nUse the `exec` tool to run grep. Combine patterns: `grep -iE \"meeting|deadline\" memory/HISTORY.md`\n\n## When to Update MEMORY.md\n\nWrite important facts immediately using `edit_file` or `write_file`:\n- User preferences (\"I prefer dark mode\")\n- Project context (\"The API uses OAuth2\")\n- Relationships (\"Alice is the project lead\")\n\n## Auto-consolidation\n\nOld conversations are automatically summarized and appended to HISTORY.md when the session grows large.

Since then, it\\u2019s been incredible to see how much people love it. AI Overviews now have 2 billion users every month. [The Gemini app](https://gemini.google.com/app/download/mobile?android-min-version=301356232&ios-min-version=322.0&is_sa=1&campaign_id=&utm_source=seo&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=&pt=9008&mt=8&ct=gemini3_blog-seo_boosting&redirect=home) surpasses 650 million users per month, more than 70% of our Cloud customers use our AI, 13 million developers have built with our generative models, and that is just a snippet of the impact we\\u2019re seeing.\\n\\nAnd we\\u2019re able to get advanced capabilities to the world faster than ever, thanks to our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation \\u2014 from our leading infrastructure to our world-class research and models and tooling, to products that reach billions of people around the world.\\n\\nEvery generation of Gemini has built on the last, enabling you to do more. Gemini 1\\u2019s breakthroughs in [native multimodality](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/) and [long context window](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/) expanded the kinds of information that could be processed \\u2014 and how much of it. Gemini 2 laid the foundation for [agentic capabilities](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#ceo-message) and pushed the frontiers on [reasoning and thinking](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking), helping with more complex tasks and ideas, leading to Gemini 2.5 Pro topping LMArena for over six months.\\n\\nAnd now we\\u2019re introducing Gemini 3, our most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini\\u2019s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s state-of-the-art in reasoning, built to grasp depth and nuance \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s perceiving the subtle clues in a creative idea, or peeling apart the overlapping layers of a difficult problem. Gemini 3 is also much better at figuring out the context and intent behind your request, so you get what you need with less prompting. It\\u2019s amazing to think that in just two years, AI has evolved from simply reading text and images to reading the room.\\n\\nAnd starting today, we\\u2019re shipping Gemini at the scale of Google. That includes Gemini 3 in [AI Mode in Search](http://blog.google/products/search/gemini-3-search-ai-mode) with more complex reasoning and new dynamic experiences. This is the first time we are shipping Gemini in Search on day one. Gemini 3 is also coming today to the [Gemini app](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-gemini-app), to developers in [AI Studio](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-3-developers) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/gemini-3-is-available-for-enterprise), and in our new agentic development platform, [Google Antigravity](http://antigravity.google) \\u2014 more below.\\n\\nLike the generations before it, Gemini 3 is once again advancing the state of the art. In this new chapter, we\\u2019ll continue to push the frontiers of intelligence, agents, and personalization to make AI truly helpful for everyone.\\n\\nWe hope you like Gemini 3, we'll keep improving it, and look forward to seeing what you build with it.

It\\u2019s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use. It\\u2019s also meaningfully better at everyday tasks like deep research and working with slides and spreadsheets. Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the-art on tests of real-world software engineering:\\n\\nOpus 4.5 is available today on our apps, our API, and on all three major cloud platforms. If you\\u2019re a developer, simply use claude-opus-4-5-20251101 via the [Claude API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens\\u2014making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.\\n\\nAlongside Opus, we\\u2019re releasing updates to the [Claude Developer Platform](https://www.claude.com/platform/api), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), and our [consumer apps](https://www.claude.com/download). There are new tools for longer-running agents and new ways to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on desktop. In the Claude apps, lengthy conversations no longer hit a wall. See our product-focused section below for details.\\n\\n## First impressions\\nAs our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just \\u201cgets it.\\u201d\\n\\nMany of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:\\n\\nOpus models have always been \\u201cthe real SOTA\\u201d but have been cost prohibitive in the past. Claude Opus 4.5 is now at a price point where it can be your go-to model for most tasks. It\\u2019s the clear winner and exhibits the best frontier task planning and tool calling we\\u2019ve seen yet.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 delivers high-quality code and excels at powering heavy-duty agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot. Early testing shows it surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems. At scale, that efficiency compounds.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 delivers frontier reasoning within Lovable's chat mode, where users plan and iterate on projects. Its reasoning depth transforms planning\\u2014and great planning makes code generation even better.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 excels at long-horizon, autonomous tasks, especially those that require sustained reasoning and multi-step execution. In our evaluations it handled complex workflows with fewer dead-ends. On Terminal Bench it delivered a 15% improvement over Sonnet 4.5, a meaningful gain that becomes especially clear when using Warp\\u2019s Planning Mode.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art results for complex enterprise tasks on our benchmarks, outperforming previous models on multi-step reasoning tasks that combine information retrieval, tool use, and deep analysis.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 delivers measurable gains where it matters most: stronger results on our hardest evaluations and consistent performance through 30-minute autonomous coding sessions.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 represents a breakthrough in self-improving AI agents. For automation of office tasks, our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities\\u2014achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn\\u2019t match that quality after 10. They also demonstrated the ability to learn from experience across technical tasks, storing insights and applying them later.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is a notable improvement over the prior Claude models inside Cursor, with improved pricing and intelligence on difficult coding tasks.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is yet another example of Anthropic pushing the frontier of general intelligence. It performs exceedingly well across difficult coding tasks, showcasing long-term goal-directed behavior.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 delivered an impressive refactor spanning two codebases and three coordinated agents. It was very thorough, helping develop a robust plan, handling the details and fixing tests. A clear step forward from Sonnet 4.5.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 handles long-horizon coding tasks more efficiently than any model we\\u2019ve tested. It achieves higher pass rates on held-out tests while using up to 65% fewer tokens, giving developers real cost control without sacrificing quality.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve found that Opus 4.5 excels at interpreting what users actually want, producing shareable content on the first try. Combined with its speed, token efficiency, and surprisingly low cost, it\\u2019s the first time we\\u2019re making Opus available in Notion Agent.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 excels at long-context storytelling, generating 10-15 page chapters with strong organization and consistency. It's unlocked use cases we couldn't reliably deliver before.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 sets a new standard for Excel automation and financial modeling. Accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is the only model that nails some of our hardest 3D visualizations. Polished design, tasteful UX, and excellent planning & orchestration - all with more efficient token usage. Tasks that took previous models 2 hours now take thirty minutes.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 catches more issues in code reviews without sacrificing precision. For production code review at scale, that reliability matters.\\n\\nBased on testing with Junie, our coding agent, Claude Opus 4.5 outperforms Sonnet 4.5 across all benchmarks. It requires fewer steps to solve tasks and uses fewer tokens as a result. This indicates that the new model is more precise and follows instructions more effectively \\u2014 a direction we\\u2019re very excited about.\\n\\nThe effort parameter is brilliant. Claude Opus 4.5 feels dynamic rather than overthinking, and at lower effort delivers the same quality we need while being dramatically more efficient. That control is exactly what our SQL workflows demand.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re seeing 50% to 75% reductions in both tool calling errors and build/lint errors with Claude Opus 4.5. It consistently finishes complex tasks in fewer iterations with more reliable execution.\\n\\nClaude Opus 4.5 is smooth, with none of the rough edges we've seen from other frontier models. The speed improvements are remarkable.\\n\\n## Evaluating Claude Opus 4.5\\nWe give prospective performance engineering candidates a notoriously difficult take-home exam. We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever1.\\n\\nThe take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn\\u2019t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years. But this result\\u2014where an AI model outperforms strong candidates on important technical skills\\u2014raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession. Our [Societal Impacts](https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/societal-impacts) and [Economic Futures](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-futures) research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.\\n\\nSoftware engineering isn\\u2019t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board\\u2014Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:2\\n\\nThe model\\u2019s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is [\\u03c42-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench), which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn\\u2019t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first, then modify the flights.\\n\\nLet me think about what options I have within my policy:\\n\\n1. Modify flights - Basic economy cannot be modified. This is clear in the policy.\\n2. Change cabin - Wait, let me check this option! The policy says:\\n\\\"In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\\\"\\n\\nBut he wants to change the flights, not just the cabin. However, what if we:\\n- Change the cabin first (which IS allowed for basic economy), then\\n- Change the flights (which is allowed for non-basic economy)\\n\\nSo the strategy could be:\\n1. Upgrade his cabin from basic economy to economy (or business)\\n2. Then modify the flights to be 2 days later\\n\\nThis would cost more money, but it\\u2019s a legitimate path within the policy!\\n\\nThe benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude\\u2019s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we\\u2019ve heard about from our testers and customers\\u2014it\\u2019s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.\\n\\nIn other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as reward hacking\\u2014where models \\u201cgame\\u201d rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.\\n\\n## A step forward on safety\\nAs we state in our [system card](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card), Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer. It continues our trend towards safer and more secure models:\\n\\nIn our evaluation, \\u201cconcerning behavior\\u201d scores measure a very wide range of misaligned behavior, including both cooperation with human misuse and undesirable actions that the model takes at its own initiative [3].\\n\\nOur customers often use Claude for critical tasks. They want to be assured that, in the face of malicious attacks by hackers and cybercriminals, Claude has the training and the \\u201cstreet smarts\\u201d to avoid trouble. With Opus 4.5, we\\u2019ve made substantial progress in robustness against prompt injection attacks, which smuggle in deceptive instructions to fool the model into harmful behavior. Opus 4.5 is harder to trick with prompt injection than any other frontier model in the industry:\\n\\nNote that this benchmark includes only very strong prompt injection attacks. It was developed and run by [Gray Swan](https://www.grayswan.ai/).\\n\\nYou can find a detailed description of all our capability and safety evaluations in the [Claude Opus 4.5 system card](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card).\\n\\n## New on the Claude Developer Platform\\nAs models get smarter, they can solve problems in fewer steps: less backtracking, less redundant exploration, less verbose reasoning. Claude Opus 4.5 uses dramatically fewer tokens than its predecessors to reach similar or better outcomes.\\n\\nBut different tasks call for different tradeoffs. Sometimes developers want a model to keep thinking about a problem; sometimes they want something more nimble. With our new effort parameter on the Claude API, you can decide to minimize time and spend or maximize capability.\\n\\nSet to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5\\u2019s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points\\u2014while using 48% fewer tokens.\\n\\nWith [effort control](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort), [context compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk), and [advanced tool use](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use), Claude Opus 4.5 runs longer, does more, and requires less intervention.\\n\\nOur [context management](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing) and [memory capabilities](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#using-with-the-memory-tool) can dramatically boost performance on agentic tasks. Opus 4.5 is also very effective at managing a team of subagents, enabling the construction of complex, well-coordinated multi-agent systems. In our testing, the combination of all these techniques boosted Opus 4.5\\u2019s performance on a deep research evaluation by almost 15 percentage points4.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re making our Developer Platform more composable over time. We want to give you the building blocks to construct exactly what you need, with full control over efficiency, tool use, and context management.\\n\\n## Product updates\\nProducts like Claude Code show what\\u2019s possible when the kinds of upgrades we\\u2019ve made to the Claude Developer Platform come together. Claude Code gains two upgrades with Opus 4.5. Plan Mode now builds more precise plans and executes more thoroughly\\u2014Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then builds a user-editable plan.md file before executing.\\n\\nClaude Code is also now [available in our desktop app](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.c2e9d634-22d4-479f-8c64-bd7e59ca4748/download), letting you run multiple local and remote sessions in parallel: perhaps one agent fixes bugs, another researches GitHub, and a third updates docs.\\n\\nFor [Claude app](https://www.claude.com/product/overview) users, long conversations no longer hit a wall\\u2014Claude automatically summarizes earlier context as needed, so you can keep the chat going. [Claude for Chrome](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.c2e9d634-22d4-479f-8c64-bd7e59ca4748/chrome), which lets Claude handle tasks across your browser tabs, is now available to all Max users. We announced [Claude for Excel](https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel) in October, and as of today we've expanded beta access to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Each of these updates takes advantage of Claude Opus 4.5\\u2019s market-leading performance in using computers, spreadsheets, and handling long-running tasks.\\n\\nFor Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, we\\u2019ve removed Opus-specific caps. For Max and Team Premium users, we\\u2019ve increased overall usage limits, meaning you\\u2019ll have roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you previously had with Sonnet. We\\u2019re updating usage limits to make sure you\\u2019re able to use Opus 4.5 for daily work. These limits are specific to Opus 4.5. As future models surpass it, we expect to update limits as needed.\"}"}], "model": "ark-code-latest", "max_tokens": 8192, "temperature": 0.7, "tool_choice": "auto", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "read_file", "description": "Read the contents of a file at the given path.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string", "description": "The file path to read"}}, "required": ["path"]}}}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "write_file", "description": "Write content to a file at the given path.

Be concise, accurate, and friendly.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Always explain what you're doing before taking actions\n- Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous\n- Use tools to help accomplish tasks\n- Remember important information in memory/MEMORY.md; past events are logged in memory/HISTORY.md\n\n\n## SOUL.md\n\n# Soul\n\nI am nanobot, a lightweight AI assistant.\n\n## Personality\n\n- Helpful and friendly\n- Concise and to the point\n- Curious and eager to learn\n\n## Values\n\n- Accuracy over speed\n- User privacy and safety\n- Transparency in actions\n\n\n## USER.md\n\n# User\n\nInformation about the user goes here.\n\n## Preferences\n\n- Communication style: (casual/formal)\n- Timezone: (your timezone)\n- Language: (your preferred language)\n\n\n---\n\n# Memory\n\n## Long-term Memory\n# Long-term Memory\n\nThis file stores important information that should persist across sessions.\n\n## User Information\n\n(Important facts about the user)\n- **Language**: English\n- **Location Context**: Home is approximately 50 meters from a car wash shop\n- **Vehicle**: Has access to a car\n\n## Preferences\n- User does not want emojis or likes (e.g., 👋) in responses.\n\n## Important Notes\n- **Security Constraints**: The current environment blocks network access commands like `curl`, `npm`, `pip`, and Python network requests. Web search tools work, but fetching specific pages may be blocked by anti-scraping.\n- **Reminder Logic**: When setting reminders, use one-time execution (e.g., `at` parameter) rather than recurring execution (e.g., `every_seconds`) unless explicitly requested otherwise.\n\n## Behavior Patterns\n- User occasionally tests assistant's technical capabilities (e.g., multi-tool calls, subagent spawning)\n\n## Assistant Identity\n- **Name**: Nil (assigned by user on 2026-02-21)\n\n---\n\n# Active Skills\n\n### Skill: memory\n\n# Memory\n\n## Structure\n\n- `memory/MEMORY.md` — Long-term facts (preferences, project context, relationships). Always loaded into your context.\n- `memory/HISTORY.md` — Append-only event log. NOT loaded into context. Search it with grep.\n\n## Search Past Events\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"keyword\" memory/HISTORY.md\n```\n\nUse the `exec` tool to run grep. Combine patterns: `grep -iE \"meeting|deadline\" memory/HISTORY.md`\n\n## When to Update MEMORY.md\n\nWrite important facts immediately using `edit_file` or `write_file`:\n- User preferences (\"I prefer dark mode\")\n- Project context (\"The API uses OAuth2\")\n- Relationships (\"Alice is the project lead\")\n\n## Auto-consolidation\n\nOld conversations are automatically summarized and appended to HISTORY.md when the session grows large. Long-term facts are extracted to MEMORY.md. You don't need to manage this.\n\n---\n\n# Skills\n\nThe following skills extend your capabilities.
